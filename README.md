Why Sokoban? Why WPF?  

Well, one of the hardest projects I have done during my education was the implementation of Sokoban in WPF (as to why, I have no idea), or rather a poor attempt at it. It was a gut-wrenching experience, but it also taught me a lot. Hence, I thought a good place to start doing small projects for myself would be to benchmark myself against what I have done in the past, and so here we are. 

I really hope someone finds it useful.

-----------------------------------------

TBD: 
Need to tidy up the input handling to reduce the clutter and possibly incorporate more expressive object orientation instead of working on int 2d arrays. 
Goal detection
Do either a global state stack or implement command pattern to allow for undo functionality
Load maps from file
Possibly a map generator
